Introduction
Sign language is a vital mode of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Converting sign language to text and then to speech can bridge the communication gap between sign language users and those who do not understand it. This project aims to develop a system that translates sign language into text and subsequently into audible speech, enhancing accessibility and inclusion. 

Objective
The primary objective is to create a seamless translation system that can accurately interpret sign language gestures and convert them into spoken words. This involves:
1. Capturing sign language gestures using a sensor or camera.
2. Processing and recognizing these gestures.
3.  Converting the recognized gestures into text.
4.  Synthesizing the text into speech.

Literature Survey
Sign Language Recognition: 
• Computer Vision Techniques: Research on gesture recognition using image processing and machine learning algorithms (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks).
• Existing Systems: Review of systems like Microsoft’s ASL Fingerspelling Translator and Google’s Gesture Recognition. 

Text Conversion: 
• Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques for text generation and context handling.
• Algorithms and Models: Use of language models like GPT-3 for generating coherent text.

Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis:
• TTS Engines: Review of TTS systems such as Google Text-to Speech, Amazon Polly, and IBM Watson. 
• Quality and Naturalness: Studies on improving the naturalness and intelligibility of synthetic speech. Technological Gaps:
